				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>RORO (roll on roll off) shipping is a very efficient way of moving trucks, busses, plant and oversize items between major cities in Australia.</p>
<p>These ships are effectively floating multi-story car parks and are about as pretty as one. However, they are extremely efficient and are only a few days slower than heavy haulage.</p>
<p>We are not limited to moving vehicles or trailers either. We can accept static plant, crates, pipes, boats and aircraft.</p>
<p>Static items can be loaded onto large trailers, called <a href="http://www.mafi.eu/products/trailers/product/cargo-rolltrailers.html">MAFIs</a>, or run onto the ship by forklift.</p>
<p>We’ve moved everything from busses, large elevated work platforms, containers, trucks to laboratories via RORO.</p>
<p>Regularly serviced cities include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Adelaide</li>
<li>Brisbane</li>
<li>Burnie</li>
<li>Darwin</li>
<li>Devonport</li>
<li>Fremantle</li>
<li>Melbourne</li>
<li>Sydney</li>
<li>Townsville</li>
</ul>
<p>Our services are available as door to door and port to port. We will take care of the whole process; including Quarantine requirements in WA and Tasmania.</p>
<p>If you have a one-off oversize shipment, or regularly move large vehicles, let us know how we can help.</p>

					<p>How Applied Logistics utilises Air Freight to keep power stations operating:</p>
<p>As a specialist domestic air freight forwarder, the team at Applied Logistics is regularly called upon by our clients to solve their urgent challenges.</p>
<p>Sometimes, these challenges are a deadline on the other side of the country, while other times it’s about having the insurance of knowing the product will arrive with plenty of time to spare.</p>
<p>Other times, our clients need to be quickly mobilised to get plant up and running with as little down time as possible.</p>
<p>Two of our clients work in the non-destructive testing (NDT) field. They use a variety of scanners to locate cracks or pin holes in pipes, so that repairs can be made. Quick identification of these failures is key to getting power stations back online; LNG plants back operating safely, and water reconnected to homes.</p>
<p>Our network allows us to place cargo on almost every passenger and freighter flight in Australia. Our limitations are size and weight. Widebody, freighter and Jetstar’s A320 aircraft have containers, which means we aren’t limited to what baggage handlers can safely handle – which is 50kgs.</p>
<p>Generally, we can get up to 50kgs per item on every flight, crates up to 1.50m high on widebody passenger aircraft and up to 2.0m high on freighter aircraft.</p>
<p>Jetstar flights can handle pallets up to 900kgs at 1.50 x 1.50 x 1.00m high. Virgin and Qantas’ passenger aircraft between the East Coast and Perth Crates up to 1.50m high can be accepted on and up to 2.0m high on freighter aircraft.</p>
<p>Sometimes it’s most convenient for our clients to collect their shipment from the nearest airport. On other occasions, it can be better to have this flown into another airport for transport to site. Sometimes, it’s imperative that we supply a hot shot delivery service to whisk your equipment to site in the early hours.</p>
<p>We monitor all flights and will provide updates in the event of delays. At any point in the journey, we can upgrade the service to bring things back ontrack.</p>
<p>Once, we provided charter boat and helicopter solutions to our client mobilising to an offshore facility.</p>
<p>Our customers rely on us to provide the best advice and options to ensure that mobilisation does not prolong down time. We communicate the different levels of service and provide guidance based on our customer’s required delivery time.</p>
<p>Time is money, but sometimes a slightly delayed service can rescue a budget.</p>
<p>Call us to discuss your logistical challenge, and how we can provide solutions that fit your budget.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Each state in Australia has different rules relating to road transport. Despite the creation of the National Heavy Vehicle Regulator (NHVR), this does not include WA or NT, and rules vary depending on the locations that your items are travelling through.</p>
<p>It is worth noting that the <a href="https://www.nhvr.gov.au">NHVR</a> is less of a Federal or COAG (Council of Australian Governments) organisation, but more a gentlemens agreement between participating states and territories (QLD, NSW, ACT, VIC, TAS, SA).</p>
<p>As a whole, Australia does a great job of regulating easily regulated modes. Think aviation, maritime and rail. Where we fall down is how we manage risk on our roads.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m a great believer in owner drivers and small fleet operators. They have a huge part to play in our economy and we need to do more as a society to help protect them from the dangers that they face every day on the nation&#8217;s highways.</p>
<p>These operators are efficient, flexible and trustworthy. Every industry has a few bad eggs and the occasional cowboy, which means that we need to do more to help the good guys.</p>
<p>The rise of compliance in this industry has brought changes equally as significant as the productivity increases that we have seen over the last 30 years. However, compliance always comes at a cost. How we manage this cost and how we engage with our small operators is crucial to the success.</p>
<p>Higher Mass Limits (HML), for example, requires enrolment in the Intelligent Access Program (IAP). This is a system that monitors and reports back instances of noncompliance in terms of location (route deviation), speed and time.</p>
<p>Performance Based Standards (PBS) is another example. The <a href="https://www.ntc.gov.au/topics/productivity/performance-based-standards-pbs/">NTC</a> developed PBS, and now it is managed by <a href="https://www.nhvr.gov.au/road-access/performance-based-standards/about-performance-based-standards">NHVR</a>. The requirements to operate certain types of vehicles requires significant investment, and what assistance is available is not often targeted at interstate linehaul operators.</p>
<p>We believe that the introduction of Electronic Work Diaries (log books), if combined with IAP, and other commercial features, would provide much needed benefits to small operators.</p>
<p>Perhaps there is a market for a compliance service provider who can provide timely, accurate advice as and when required for small operators.</p>
<p>In the meantime, consider the fragmentation of the regulators&#8230;</p>
<p>COAG Government Organisations:</p>
<ul>
<li>National Heavy Vehicle Regulator (<a href="https://www.nhvr.gov.au">NHVR</a>)</li>
<li>Office of the National Rail Safety Regulator (<a href="https://www.onrsr.com.au">ONRSR</a>)</li>
<li>National Transport Commission (<a href="https://www.ntc.gov.au">NTC</a>)</li>
<li><a href="http://transportinfrastructurecouncil.gov.au">Transport and Infrastructure Council</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Federal Government Organisations:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://infrastructure.gov.au">Department of Infrastructure, Regional Development and Cities</a></li>
<li>Australian Maritime Safety Authority (<a href="https://www.amsa.gov.au">AMSA</a>)</li>
<li>Civil Aviation Safety Authority (<a href="https://www.casa.gov.au">CASA</a>)</li>
<li>Australian Transport Safety Bureau (<a href="http://www.atsb.gov.au">ATSB</a>)</li>
<li><a href="http://infrastructureaustralia.gov.au">Infrastructure Australia</a></li>
